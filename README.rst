processing
==========

Software for time-series analysis, spectral analysis and transfer function computation from geophysical data.

Why
---

TODO: purpose of the library.

Scope
-----
- Time series processing
- Spectral analysis
- Transfer functions

Where we are
------------
- Start by focussing on Magnetotelluric data
- we are in the scoping / planning stages, so sketching out the library in issues
