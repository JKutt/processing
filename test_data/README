------------

The time series data are sampled at 256 samples/s.  

The header has the following format:

station_name, component, sampling_rate, start_time_in_epoch_seconds, num_samples, latitude, longitude, elevation

The files can be read with:

[1]: from mtpy.utils import filehandling as mtfh
[2]: ts = mtfh.read_ts_file(file_name)

If cloning MTpy, be sure to checkout the 'beta' branch, that is the one that is most up to date.
